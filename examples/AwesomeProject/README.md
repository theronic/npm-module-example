# shadow-cljs and react-native + haul

This was created by `react-native init AwesomeProject` and then adding `haul` to replace the default `react-native` packager. The default doesn't handle the generated CLJS code very well as it will run it through various babel transforms. The code will work but it takes forever to process. `haul` just uses webpack and has no such issues.

```
yarn
shadow-cljs --once
yarn run haul start -- --platform=ios
react-native run-ios
```
