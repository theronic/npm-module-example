# Development

You run `yarn start` and `lein cljs-watch` side by side.

`yarn` should open a webpage at `http://localhost:3000`, the "Hello World" is from CLJS.

# Production

`lein cljs` and then `yarn run build`.

## project.clj

This will go away eventually, as will the `lein run`. Imagine there was a `shadow-npm` package in `npm` which you would install with `yarn add shadow-npm`. While it will still require a JVM, it won't require `lein`.
