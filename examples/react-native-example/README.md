## create-react-app example

This was generated by `yarn create react-native-app`.

Start CLJS compile `sh ./cljs.sh --watch` and then `yarn start`.

This is the first time I ever used React Native, I don't know why it takes so long to start:

```
1:14:35 PM: Finished building JavaScript bundle in 113550ms
```

Also their live-reloading doesn't seem to work for CLJS.

It still works well enough for a proof-of-concept, didn't look at any details yet.

This time without `lein`, just a plain `shadow-devtools` uberjar.
